# Poker_AI

To run the algorithms in this Repository, which will classify poker hands, run the PokerRunner.py file.

Each algorithm is trained on a dataset containing 1,000,000 samples, they are then tested on a different dataset containing 25,010 samples.

Repository for the classification of Poker Hands, using 3 different AI/ML Techniques.

Done as part of our End of the Year Machine Learning Project for CSC 3520 at Florida Southern College.

Contributors: Austin Scheetz, Anselmis 'AC' Columna, Sebastian 'Skippy' Paquette.
Date: Fall Semester 2022 (November - December time period)

The 3 different AI/ML techniques used for classification are: Neural Networks, Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines.

The Neural Networks algorithm was completed by Austin.

The Decision Trees algorithm was completed by AC.

The Support Vector Machines algorithm was completed by Sebastian 'Skippy'.
